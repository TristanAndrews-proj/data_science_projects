    "# Fighting Gambling addiction by gambling Smarter\n",
    "People start playing the lottery for fun, but some people eventually find this activity addictive and become compulsive gamblers who gambles away their savings and loans, and desperately participate in illegal behaviours such theft. \n",
    " A medical institue aims to prevent and treat gambling addiction by building a mobile app that helps lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. A Software engineering team will build the app but they need assistance in creating the logical core and calculating the probabilities. \n",
    "For the fist version of the app, we will be focusing on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that would allow users to answer the following questions: \n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different - tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll create two functions: a function that calculates factorials, and one calculates combinations."

    "- Combining the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.\n",
